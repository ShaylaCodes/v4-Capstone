# Library Data Analysis & Visualization Project

## Description

This is where you describe your project. What does it do? Why is it useful? What problem does it solve? This section should be a few sentences or a paragraph long.

The code is a Python implementation of a library managment system. It allows the user to persofrm many operations related to managing library members and books. The library managment system solves the problem of efficiently managing book records, handling membership info and tracking borrowed books. Key functionalities - 
1- Allowing members to borrow and return books 
2- Display the list of books and members
3- Registering a new member and maintaining the information of the new member
4- Fetching information of a borrowed books and active members

## Installation

Describe how to install your project. What software does it depend on? Are there any environment variables to set? List the steps someone needs to take to get your project up and running on their own machine.

To install the project, ensure that you create a new directory or navigate to an exisiting directory of your liking where you want to set the project up. Install pip install psycopg2 for PostfreSQL connection and matplotlib for data visualization. When setting up PostgreSQL database, ensure that you have the correct connect information from your database. Creating a .env file in the same directory of the project. The  .env file should look similar to this. 
DB_HOST = 'Host'
DB_DATABASE = 'Database'
DB_USER = 'User' 
DB_PASSWORD = 'Password'
DB_PORT = 'Port'

Be sure to import the necessary libraries and modules correctly.


```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-data-analysis-and-visualization.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd library-data-analysis-and-visualization

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Explain how to use your project. What commands do they need to run? Are there any particular files they should look at? What output should they expect?

To use the library, you can perform various operations by using the 'library' object. 
The following commands and methods that can be used:

Removing a book from the library
library.remove_book("book Title")

Adding a book to te library:
library.add_book("Title","Author","Catagory") 

Registering a new member:
library.register_member("name","member_id")

Borrowing a book:
library.borrow_book("member_id","Title")

You can also display every book available in the library and display all library members by using the following commands:

Displaying all library members: 
library.display_all_members()

Displaying all books in the library:
library.display_all_members() 

Using the provided commands and methods, you to navigate throughout the library, adding and removing books, borrowing and returning books, register a new library member, and retrieve information of a book or information of a member.


```python
# Import the project
from library_analysis import LibraryAnalysis

# Create a new instance
analysis = LibraryAnalysis()

# Run the analysis
analysis.run()
```

## Contributors

## Data Analysis and Visualization

Describe the data analysis and visualization part of your project. What insights does it generate? How are these visualizations created? Include examples of the visualizations, if possible.

## Error Handling

Describe how your project handles errors. If there are known issues with your project, list them here.

## License

If your project is open-source, it's a good idea to include a license here. If you're not sure what to choose, look at [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) for advice.

This README template covers the basic sections that most projects should include. Depending on your project, you might want to add more sections - for example, if your project has a lot of code, you might want to add a section that describes the project structure or gives a high-level overview of the codebase.
